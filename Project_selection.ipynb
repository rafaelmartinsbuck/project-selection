    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important deliverables of a project portfolio management is to maximize the mix of projects to drive the highest possible corporate value. It is important to establish an enterprise-wide prioritization process that objectively and continuously evaluates projects and programmes to help maximize and realize the value from the investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds like a combinatorial optimization problem. Like the [Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem), given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. Try combinate all items in a \"Brute Force\" strategy is O(2^n) time! So we need use dynamic programming to deal with more projects. Using dynamic programming, we achieve O(nW) (Pseudo-polynomial time) what is much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we will work only with 2 dimensions: \n",
    "- Size of the project (effort in man-month)\n",
    "- Value of the project (return in USD million)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to maximize the financial return using the maximum available capacity of the company. So, use knapsack approach with dynamic programming to solve this problem is an interesting choice. "
