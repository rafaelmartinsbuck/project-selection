# Project selection analysis

### 1. Introduction
One of the most important deliverables of a project portfolio management is to maximize the mix of projects to drive the highest possible corporate value. It is important to establish an enterprise-wide prioritization process that objectively and continuously evaluates projects and programmes to help maximize and realize the value from the investment.

### 2. Solution
In this analysis we will work only with 2 dimensions:
- Size of the project (effort in man-month)
- Value of the project (return in USD million)

We want to maximize the financial return using the maximum available capacity of the company. So, use knapsack approach with dynamic programming to solve this problem is an interesting choice.

### 3. Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and you will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### 4. Run

In a terminal or command window run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook Project_selection.ipynb```  
```jupyter notebook Project_selection.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
